The languages used are HTML, JS, React-application.
The app was built on foundational Auth0 SDKs.
The user needs to first setup base code using Auth0's quickstart guide for Login and Call API functionality of the website.
Followed the blog on https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/
Running the app on ec2 instance, on 4040 port.
